Objective 1:

It appears the the fidelity changes widely in the 0-20000 shots range. However, past that range it begins to stablize a bit, with the most stable "era" starting around 75000 - 80000 shots. Quantum computing is most certainly chaotic.


Objective 2:

In order of effectiveness:
	1) Simulation, with very high fideility average in the high 0.998+
	2) Emulation, with a varying average (upper bound = ~0.95, lower bound = ~ 0.85). Average was much more stable than running
		simulations on the actual hardware and tended to stabilize as shot amount increased.
	3) Real hardware, with a WIDE varying average (upper bound = ~0.975, lower bound = ~0.65). Do note that I ran these tests
		on emerald. [I might add some garnet tests later to see if its different]. What I found most interesting about
		the real hardware was that it actually performed the BEST on lower shot counts (highest was at shots = 200),
		with it severly distabilizing once it hit the shots range of 2500 - 20000.
