# NGPTesting
This repo is a collection of every code-related activity I did during my time as an NGP TA (teacher's assistant). This does NOT (currently) include things I made in the google suite (changes to NGP schedule, curriculum, student feasability sheet, etc.) but may be added later. It has all of my hands-on-with-odo challenges, some of the things I wrote for those, and some of the other scripts I wrote when teaching students various basics (such as C, python, bash, etc.)

## hands-on-with-odo-challenges
One of my primary objectives during this internship was to create a rubric for applying the hands-on-with-odo to NGP students. As a part of that, I had to complete each and every challenge in the olcf/hands-on-with-odo fork of the hands-on-with-frontier challenge, which was a workshop designed for undergradutate students and faculty members to learn the basics of High Performance Computing (hpc). I attached the rubric to this repo, as well as the proof of (most) of the challenges. Not all proofs could be added.
