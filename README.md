# NGPTesting
This repo is a collection of every code-related activity I did during my time as an NGP TA (teacher's assistant). This does NOT (currently) include things I made in the google suite (changes to NGP schedule, curriculum, student feasability sheet, etc.) but may be added later. It has all of my hands-on-with-odo challenges, some of the things I wrote for those, and some of the other scripts I wrote when teaching students various basics (such as C, python, bash, etc.)
