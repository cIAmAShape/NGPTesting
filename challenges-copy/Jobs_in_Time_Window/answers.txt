Command I used to get the answers for Q3:
	sacct --allusers --starttime 2025-02-01 --endtime 2025-02-15 --noheader --format=JobID,JobName,State,Start,Elapsed,Submit 
		| awk '{print $5, $1, $4, $6}' | sort

	The other questions were the same, but only using [ | wc -l ] for counting total jobs 
	and [ | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l "] for counting unique job ID's



Q1: 36767 Jobs between the 1st and 15th of Feb, 2025.


Q2: 30759 Unique ID's from Q1 Timeslot


Q3: ID 4005 ran for 4 hours and 3 seconds.
	i) It was not pending in the queue (0 seconds between submit time and start time)
	ii) It was submitted 2025-02-14 at T 21:18:16
