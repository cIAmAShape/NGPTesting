# Intro to Bash

Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter, shell, and scripting language used almost ubiquitously across Unix-base and many macOS systems. Much of the function of bash is based around managing an operating system. Created by Brian Fox in around 1988, BASH has since recevied continous development [throughout its history](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-linux-shells/) and to the present. 

BASH is a very helpful language to know. Like any programming language, it has its strengths and weaknesses. But often times, BASH is used as a "supplemantary" language - A language that helps you work with, run, and move around other scripts, files, and directories.
