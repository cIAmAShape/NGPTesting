# Intro to Bash

Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter, shell, and scripting language used almost ubiquitously across Unix-base and many macOS systems. Much of the function of bash is based around managing an operating system. Created by Brian Fox in around 1988, BASH has since recevied continous development [throughout its history](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-linux-shells/) and to the present.
