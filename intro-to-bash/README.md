# Intro to Bash

Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter, shell, and scripting language used almost ubiquitously across Unix-base and many macOS systems. Much of the function of bash is based around managing an operating system. Created by Brian Fox in around 1988, BASH has since received continuous development [throughout its history](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-linux-shells/) and to the present. 

Bash is a very helpful language to learn. It provides a very powerful and direct way to communicate with your computer without using a GUI. However, its power is also a weakness: there are no "undo" buttons when moving, removing, copying, or otherwise manipulating files or data. Always write bash scripts with this in mind. 









# So, why do we use Bash anyway? When is it used in HPC?
