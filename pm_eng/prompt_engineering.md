# Prompt Engineering

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are powerful tools trained on massive amounts of text to predict and generate human-like language. They don’t "think" or "reason" the way humans do; instead, they statistically predict the next word in a sentence based on the input they’ve seen. <br />
Because LLMs respond based on patterns, *how you ask a question directly affects the quality of the answer*. This is why **prompt engineering** — the practice of crafting inputs to get the most effective outputs — is so important. It helps bridge the gap between your intention and what the model actually delivers. <br />
The main thing that you need to know: asking just one question is **rarely** enough to help. Unless you have a generic and simple problem - such as asking an LLM to remind you what the area of a sphere is - it likely won’t be a result applicable to your research.
